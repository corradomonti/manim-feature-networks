# Feature-rich Networks With Manim

This repository is a quick scrapbook of some code I developed for the short video presenting our article **"Evidence of Demographic rather than Ideological Segregation in News Discussion on Reddit"** at the ACM Web Conference 2023 (WWW'23). Unfortunately, the code is rough and undocumented (I'm sharing it after a request).

The full video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOpZVaVVIw).

This video was made possible by that amazing library that is [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).
